The mini project for OOSE 2015
This application is supposed to go hand in hand with the glove we created for fourth semester. 
The glove had 4 pressure sensors that would control different sound effects. The application is a GUi for this purpose,
and you would drag an effect to the specified finger.

This was made last year so it wasn't built from ground up in github.
